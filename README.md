CMakeCatchTemplate
------------------

This is a simple project to demonstrate a reasonable
structure for a cmake/ctest and Catch based projects.

You can either
 1. Clone this repo, and use directly
 2. Export the project (without a .git folder), and then rename all instances of MYPROJECT,
 myproject, MyProject with names of your choice, and then create your own project.
 Do this by editing `rename.sh` with the relevant names then running with `./rename.sh`.
 _NOTE: Will not work (reliably) after running CMake in the directory for the first time._   

Overview

Build Instructions

Preferred Branching Workflow
----------------------------

 1. Raise issue in this project's Github Issue Tracker.
 2. Fork repository.
 3. Create a feature branch called ```<issue-number>-<some-short-description>```
    replacing ```<issue-number>``` with the Github issue number
    and ```<some-short-description>``` with your description of the thing you are implementing.
 4. Code on that branch.
 5. Push to your remote when ready.
 6. Create pull request.
 7. We will review code, and merge to master when it looks ready.
