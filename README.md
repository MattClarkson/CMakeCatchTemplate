Build Instructions
-----------------------------


Preferred Branching Workflow
----------------------------

 1. Raise issue in this project's Github Issue Tracker.
 2. Fork repository.
 3. Create a feature branch called ```<issue-number>-<some-short-description>```
    replacing ```<issue-number>``` with the Github issue number
    and ```<some-short-description>``` with your description of the thing you are implementing.
 4. Code on that branch.
 5. Push to your remote when ready.
 6. Create pull request.
 7. We will review code, and merge to master when it looks ready.
