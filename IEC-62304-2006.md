Introduction
------------

This software contained in this project does not claim compliance with IEC-62304:2006.

That said, some of the co-authors are interested in the development of medical device
software. So, for the sake of an exercise, the following table compares
the development process of this software with the IEC-62304:2006 standard.

Comparison
----------

### General General Requirements

Item | Brief Description (refer to full standard text). | Class | Compliance | To Do (Corrective Action)
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
4.1 | The manufacturer of medical device software shall demonstrate the ability to provide medical device software that consistently meets customer requirements and applicable regulatory requirements - e.g. developed within ISO 13485. | A,B,C | Not compliant | Follow documented process in a specific ISO 13485 QMS instance.
4.2 | The manufacturer shall apply a risk management process compliant with ISO 14971. | A,B,C | Not compliant | Risk analysis should be done at the product level, not the library level and follow documented ISO 14971 process.
4.3 | The manufacturer shall assign to each software system a software safety class (A, B, or C) according to the possible effects on the patient, operator, or other people resulting from a hazard to which the software system can contribute. | A,B,C | Not compliant | Following Risk Analysis, a software safety class should be classified at the product/system level. The best we can offer here is to claim which of the clauses of IEC-62304 have been implemented.
